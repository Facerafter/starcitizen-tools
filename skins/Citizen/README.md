# Citizen
Citizen is a responsive skin for [MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org) built by the [Star Citizen Wiki](https://starcitizen.tools) team. Although it is built for the Star Citizen Wiki, the skin should be able to run on any Mediawiki installation that is 1.31 or higher. Due to resource constraint, we are currently not taking any support requests unless it is relvant to our installation, but feel free to submit pull requests if you find a bug!
